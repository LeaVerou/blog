You have likely participated in several [Devographics surveys](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US) before,
such as [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com/en-us/), or [State of JS](https://stateofjs.com/en-us/).
These surveys have become the primary source of unbiased data for the practices of front-end developers today
(there is also the [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/) research, but because this studies what is used on the web, it takes a lot longer for changes in developer practices to propagate).

You may remember that last summer, [Google sponsored me to be Survey Design Lead](/blog/2022/07/help-design-the-state-of-css-survey-2022/) for [State of CSS 2022](https://survey.devographics.com/en-US/survey/state-of-css/2022).
It went really well: we got 60% higher response rate than the year before, which gave browsers a lot of actionable data to prioritize their work.
The feedback from these surveys is some of the primary inputs for the [Interop](https://web.dev/interop-2023/) project,
where browsers collaborate to implement the most important features for developers interoperably.

So this summer, Google trusted me with a mich bigger project, a brand new survey: **State of HTML**!

<!-- more -->

Designing a brand new survey is a more daunting task than creating the new edition of an existing survey,
but also an exciting one, as comparability with the data from prior years is not a concern,
so there is a lot more freedom.

Each *State of X* survey consists of two parts:
Part 1 is a quiz: a long list of less known and/or cutting edge or even upcoming features where respondents select one of three options:

![Screenshot of question saying "Custom Elements" with answers 🤷 Never heard of it/Not sure what it is, ✅ Know what it is, but haven't used it, 👍 I've used it](images/image.png)
Starting with State of CSS 2022, respondents could also add freeform comments to provide more context about their answer.
One of my goals this year is to make this feature quicker to use for common types of feedback,
and to facilitate quantitative analysis of the responses (to some degree).

At the end of the survey, respondents even get a score based on their answers and a rank compared to other respondents,
which provides value to them and motivates them to fill out the survey.
Part 2 is more freeform, and usually includes multiple choice questions about tools and resources, freeform questions about pain points, and of course demographics.

One of the novel things I tried in the State of CSS survey was to [involve the community in the design process](/blog/2022/07/help-design-the-state-of-css-survey-2022/),
with one click voting for the features to ask about.
These were actually GitHub Issues with certain labels.
Two years prior I had released [MaVoice: an app to facilitate one click voting on Issues in *any* repo](/blog/2020/07/releasing-mavoice-a-free-app-to-vote-on-repo-issues/),
and it [fit the bill perfectly here](https://projects.verou.me/mavoice/?repo=devographics/surveys&labels=State%20of%20CSS%202022).

This process worked exceptionally well for uncovering blind spots: it turned out there were a bunch of CSS features that would be good to ask about, but were simply not on our radar.
This is one of the reasons transparency is one of my core values: no one human or small team can ever match the collective intelligence of the community.

Predictably, I plan to do the same thing for State of HTML.
Instead of using MaVoice, this year I’ve decided to use GitHub Discussions.
These allow one click voting from the GitHub interface itself,
without users having to give permissions to a separate app.
They also allow for more discussion, and they do not clutter Issues, which are better suited for -- well -- actual issues.
I have created a Discussions category for this and seeded it with 55 features spanning 12 focus areas (Forms & Editing, Making Web Components, Consuming Web Components, ARIA & Accessibility APIs, Embedding, Multimedia, Interactivity, Semantic HTML, Templating, Bridging the gap with native, Performance, Security & Privacy).
These initial ideas came from a combination of personal research, as well as some brainstorming sessions with the [WebDX CG](https://www.w3.org/community/webdx/).

<a class="call-to-action" href="https://github.com/Devographics/surveys/discussions/categories/state-of-html-2023-features">Vote on Features for State of HTML 2023!</a>

You can also see a (read-only) summary of the proposed features with their metadata [here](https://coda.io/@leaverou/html-features)
though keep in mind that it may not not include any new proposals, as it’s manually updated.

If you can think of features we missed, please post a new Discussion in this category!

Some things to keep in mind:
- The votes and proposals collected through this process are only one of the many variables that feed into deciding what to ask about, and are **non-binding**.
- There are two important goals to balance here: 1) Ask about a wide enough set of features so that the quiz score is meaningful to developers 2) Get browsers actionable feedback that can feed into prioritization for what to implement. Both are equally important.
- While the title is "State of HTML", certain JS APIs or even CSS syntax is also relevant, especially those very close to HTML, such as DOM, ARIA, Web Components, PWAs etc.
- Stable features that have existed for a long time and are widely known are generally less likely to make it to the survey.
